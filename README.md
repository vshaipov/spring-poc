# spring-poc
This is a spring core features example. It can simply be reused as a getting started project based on following spring features.
this project also contains an integration tests (spring-poc-integration-tests) module, which should be run only when the major spring-poc-app is deployed.

1. RESTful servicers<br>
2. Spring AOP<br>
3. Spring security. All the exposed REST methods require a basic authentication. See its integration tests in spring-poc-integration-tests module  for different access cases, supporting several users and appropriate acess roles<br>
