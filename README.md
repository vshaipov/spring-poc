# spring-poc
This is a spring core features example. It can simply be reused as a getting started project based on following spring features <br>
1. RESTful servicers<br>
2. spring AOP<br>
3. spring security. All the exposed REST methods require a basic authentication.<br>
   Calling /spring-poc/lib/books or any other REST method prompts a log in page with valid credentials "user" and "password"
